Let me give you a quick introduction of myself.

Hi!
I'm Dave.

I don't go by David. If you call me David it is a sign to me that you are either my Mother, a Credit Card collections agency or we don't know each other well.

I studied film in college. I spent my whole career since then working as a Web Developer for a print shop. So if there are things that I know pretty well, it's Web Development, Print Production and Movies.

I'm a voracious nerd. (I looked up voracious to make sure I was using it correctly here. I am but it's a bit of a stretch). I love the Star Treks, the Star Wars (up until recently, that it, I love watching Disney beat the things I like to death as much as the next guy, but I think I'm finally just kind of done with new Star Wars stuff.).

I dig scifi novels. I'm particularly obsessed with Neal Stephenson to the point where I feel like one rough week at work and I'd start stalking him.

## Why the blog?
It's an outlet for me to be creative and think critically. It's not specifically for anyone other than myself.

I sometimes feel like not doing creative things will cause brain atrophy.

So here I am. Writing stuff about history, computer science, film, literature and music.

I'm going to try for a post a week, but who knows how that will go.

Thanks for reading.
